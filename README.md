Implementation of a neural network and the Braitenberg algorithm to control a pionner robot. 
The neural networks is not working properly and is not able to learn through reinforcment learning. Therefore, the implementation is finished (both commands are working at the same time), but the neural network is not having a positive effect. 

Will keep working on it to try and fnd the solution
