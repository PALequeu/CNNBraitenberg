# CNNBraitenberg
Project made as a final project for the **foundation of robotics** class taken at Mines Nancy.

Implementation of a neural network and the Braitenberg algorithm to control a pionner robot.
The NN learns through reinforcement learning how the robot should turn give the inputs of the sensors in order to avoid bumping into walls.
The repository also has a simple map generator used to test the model.
